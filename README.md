# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

We were asked by the CEO of PyBer, a ride sharing app company, to create a summary of the given trip data and organize it by the different city types, urban, suburban, and rural. Then, create a multiple line graph representing the data we found in the summary.

## Results

### Chart Results

Looking at the chart pictured below, we can see that the total number of rides, fares and number of drivers are far greater in the more urban areas versus the rural or suburban areas.  As a result, the rural and suburban cities have a far greater average fare per ride and higher average fare per driver.

### Graph Results

From the graph pictured below, we can notice that the total fare amount is much greater in the urban areas than the suburban and rural areas. All three city types have peaks and valleys around the same times of the year. Most notably these peaks come in the last week of February and the first week of April and the valleys in the first week of January and last week of March.
