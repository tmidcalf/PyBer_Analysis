# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

We were asked by the CEO of PyBer, a ride sharing app company, to create a summary of the given trip data and organize it by the different city types, urban, suburban, and rural. Then, create a multiple line graph representing the data we found in the summary.

## Results

### Chart Results

Looking at the chart pictured below, we can see that the total number of rides, fares and number of drivers are far greater in the more urban areas versus the rural or suburban areas.  As a result, the rural and suburban cities have a far greater average fare per ride and higher average fare per driver.

### Graph Results

From the graph pictured below, we can notice that the total fare amount is much greater in the urban areas than the suburban and rural areas. All three city types have peaks and valleys around the same times of the year. Most notably these peaks come in the last week of February and the first week of April and the valleys in the first week of January and last week of March.

## Summary

- One suggestion I would make regarding disparities among the city types is to hire less drivers for the urban areas. As it stands, right now we can see there are more drivers than there are total rides. Ideally we would like to see more rides than drivers like we  see have in the rural and suburban areas.
- Next, because the average fare per ride in the urban areas is nearly ten dollars less than the rural and six less than the suburban, I would suggest increasing the fare price for rides in urban areas. This would bring fares in urban areas closer to the averages of rural and suburban areas.
- Last, I would suggest some sort of promotion for rides in the first weeks of January and March in the coming year. This helps promote the business in the slower weeks of the year.
